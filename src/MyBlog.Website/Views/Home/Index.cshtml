        <h4>Hi</h4>
        <p>
            Welcome to my blog! I mostly write stuff about Sitecore performance and
            optimizations and stuff about testing as well. I've been hacking Sitecore the last 10 years,
            ever since version 4 and learned a lot in the process that I would like to share.
